# using this list: 
basket = ["Banana", ["Apples", ["Oranges"], "Blueberries"]];
# access "Oranges" and print it:
# You will find the answer if you scroll down to the bottom, but attempt it yourself first!




print(basket[1][1][0])





x, y, z, *rest = (1, 2, 3, 'Dennis', 'Rohan', 23, -23)
print(rest)

# Using a tuple as a dictionary key
locations = {
    (40.71, -74.00): "New York City",
    (34.05, -118.24): "Los Angeles"
}
print(locations[(34.05,-118.24)])
print(locations.keys())

























# Solution:
# basket[1][1][0]
